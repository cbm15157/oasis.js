oasis.js provides a collection of tools to interact with Secure Services running
on the Oasis blockchain. If you're new to Oasis, first checkout the `oasis docs <https://docs.oasis.dev/>`_. For
developing services, check out the `oasis-rs docs <https://github.com/oasislabs/oasis-rs>`_.

If you're developing or interacting with traditional Ethereum contracts, it's
recommended to use one of our favorite Ethereum libraries like `ethers.js`_ or `web3.js`_.
